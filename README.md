Stroke Prediction System
________________________________________
1. Introduction
Stroke Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the risk of an individual experiencing a stroke in the future. Stroke is a serious medical condition that occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, leading to brain damage and potentially life-threatening complications. Early prediction of stroke risk can aid in preventive healthcare measures and timely interventions to reduce the likelihood of stroke occurrence.

2. Data Sources
The dataset used for training and testing the Stroke Prediction System is sourced from the "healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv" file. This dataset contains various attributes of individuals, including demographic information, medical history, and lifestyle factors, along with a binary target variable indicating whether the individual had a stroke (1) or not (0).

3. Methodology
The Stroke Prediction System follows a systematic approach consisting of the following steps:
Step 1: Data Preprocessing
•	Handling missing values: Missing values in the dataset, particularly in the BMI (Body Mass Index) column, are addressed by replacing them with the mean value of the respective column.
•	Normalization: Numeric columns are normalized using Min-Max scaling to ensure all features are on a similar scale, preventing dominance by features with larger magnitudes.
•	Feature Selection: Selecting the most relevant features for prediction using SelectKBest, which employs the chi-squared statistical test to determine the top k features that have the strongest relationship with the target variable.
Step 2: Model Training and Evaluation
•	Three machine learning algorithms are applied and evaluated for stroke prediction: Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.
•	Model Evaluation Metrics: The performance of each model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall scores on both training and testing datasets.
•	Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV is utilized to tune the hyperparameters of the models to improve their performance.(the majorly stucking portion)

4. Model Architecture
The Stroke Prediction System employs the following machine learning algorithms:
Decision Trees:
•	A Decision Tree is a flowchart-like tree structure where each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision, and each leaf node represents an outcome.
•	Decision Trees are capable of handling both numerical and categorical data and are interpretable, making them suitable for understanding the factors contributing to stroke prediction.
Logistic Regression:
•	Logistic Regression is a statistical model used for binary classification tasks.
•	It estimates the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables.
•	Logistic Regression is widely used for its simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability.
Random Forest:
•	Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training.
•	It operates by building multiple decision trees and merging their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
•	Random Forest is known for its robustness and ability to handle high-dimensional data with complex relationships.

5. Instructions for Using the Prediction System
Prerequisites:
Ensure the "healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv" file is available in the working directory.
Steps:
1.	Import the necessary libraries: NumPy, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn.
2.	Load the dataset using pandas: disease_data = pd.read_csv('healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv').
3.	Perform data preprocessing steps: handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection.
4.	Split the dataset into independent (features) and dependent (target) variables: X = df.drop(columns='stroke', axis=1) and Y = df['stroke'].
5.	Train and evaluate machine learning models such as Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest for stroke prediction.
6.	Optionally, tune the hyperparameters of the models using GridSearchCV to improve performance.
7.	Use the trained model to predict stroke risk for new data by providing the relevant feature values as input.

6. Conclusion
The Stroke Prediction System offers a valuable tool for healthcare professionals and individuals to assess the risk of stroke based on various demographic, medical, and lifestyle factors. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and comprehensive data analysis, the system aids in early detection and proactive management of stroke risk, ultimately contributing to better healthcare outcomes and improved quality of life.
